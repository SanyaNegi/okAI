Coccinelle

Using Coccinelle on the Linux kernel
A Coccinelle-specific target is defined in the top level Makefile. This target is named coccicheck and 
calls the coccicheck front-end in the scripts directory.

Four basic modes are defined: patch, report, context, and org. The mode to use is specified by setting 
the MODE variable with MODE=<mode>.

patch proposes a fix, when possible.
report generates a list in the following format: file:line:column-column: message
context highlights lines of interest and their  sorry_shaktiman context in a diff-like style.Lines of interest are 
indicated with -. org generates a report in the Org mode format of Emacs.
Note that not all semantic patches implement all modes. For easy use of Coccinelle, the default mode is “report”.

Two other modes provide some common combinations of these modes.

chain tries the previous modes in the order above until one succeeds.
rep+ctxt runs successively the report mode and the context mode. It should be used with the C option (described later) which
checks the code on a file basis.
